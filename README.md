## Project Motivation
My motivation for the project arises from my curiosity to better understand the following:

- Number of movies produced over decades and increase in revenue
- Most popular genres (in terms of revenue) in the decades between 1920 and 2010
- Building a recommendation engine for users recommending movies based on genre, director and the lead

## Project Tasks
I. Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploring the data to find patterns and dive into the details of the provided dataset

II. Data Cleaning and Merge

The raw data needs to be cleaned up and transformed to prepare it for analysis. We use data cleaning and transformation method to help derive a merged database for analysis

III. Observations and Recommendations

We look at specific parameters such as genre, director and lead to help recommend similar movies for users


## File Descriptions
The data is contained in below two files:

movies_metadata.csv: The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.

credits.csv: Consists of Cast and Crew Information for all our movies. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.

## Running the code
Installations required before running the code:

no external libraries are required for installation
